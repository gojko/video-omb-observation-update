Hi, the first thing you need to do is install our map on your mobile device by opening the URL displayed above. 

You can also find this URL in the description below.

Opening the URL will prompt you to install an application called Field Maps if you don't have it already. It will then open the map.

![](Field Maps Initial.png)

You'll notice a lot of different coloured markers on the map. 

Each marker represents a weed patch and is coloured to show the current status of the patch.

You may need to zoom in further to get a clearer view.

We're interested in updating the status of the "Purple - Please Check" dots.

![00:00-00:06](Field Maps OMB.mp4)

Click on any of the purple Old Man's Beard symbols. The map shows multiple species, so make sure it's Old Man's Beard you've clicked on.

If there's a few weeds reported nearby, you'll see a list of all the weeds, so work through them one by one.

You'll see some basic information about the weed and possibly some location details.

The GPS position isn't always right, so you may need to hunt around a bit to find it.

If you need more info to help find it, click on the link under iNaturalist URL. 

This will open the iNaturalist page which will show more details including photos to help you find it.

Let's try finding a known Old Man's Beard patch.

Once Field Maps has been installed, opening Field Maps will default to showing our CAMS map.

After zooming in to my current location, I see I need to walk down the road a bit to get to the Old Man's Beard patch.

(voice: keith)

I'm getting close, so I'll click on the icon to find out more details about this patch.

There's no location details, so I'll click on the iNaturalist URL to see a photo of it.

That looks like the bank across the road from me.

Let's click on the photo, so I can zoom in and see where the Old Man's Beard is in the photo.

There it is on the top right of the bank.

(voice: keith)

Looking around the bank now, the Old Man's Beard vines seem to have been mostly controlled. But I can see some regrowth at the top of the bank.

---
![](OMB Mortimer 2.jpeg)

(voice: keith)

Walking around above the bank the new growth is a bit more clear.

I'll need to update the map to show that it is still alive. 

How do I do that Brooke?

Checking this map, we see this dot has turned to "Red" to show there is active growth.

This might seem like a lot of work to start with, but it quickly becomes second nature.

In time, we hope to develop an app to make this easier.
