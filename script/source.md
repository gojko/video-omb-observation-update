# Updating Old Man's Beard status
```

(pause: 4)

![](CAMS Weed App.png)

Hi! On our mission to make Wellington Old Man's Beard Free, we've created a map to manage and track our efforts to control Old Man's Beard.

This map is colour coded to show which patches need control, which have been controlled, and which need checking. 

The weed status is reset to "Purple - Please Check" each Spring, so that we check for any regrowth or seedlings.

With over 3,000 reported Old Man's Beard patches, we can't check them all!

We'd love your help to check some of them and update this map. 

This video shows you how to find these patches and update their status.

## Open the **CAMS public device map** link in the description below
```

The first thing you need to do is install our map on your mobile device by clicking on the link in the description below. 

Opening the link will prompt you to install an application called ArcGIS Field Maps if you don't have it already.

Then open the link again and it will show the map. Select the option to enable location while using the app.

In future, you can just open Field Maps and it will show the map that you last opened.

---

![](Field Maps Initial.png)

You'll notice a lot of different coloured markers on the map. 

Each marker represents a weed patch and is coloured to show the current known status of the patch.

* Purple - the patch needs checking
* Red - growth is occurring which needs controlling
* Yellow - the patch has been controlled this year
* Green - there is no regrowth this year
```

The common colours are:

You may need to zoom in further to get a clearer view.

We're interested in updating the status of the "Purple - Please Check" dots.

![00:00-00:06](Field Maps OMB.mp4)

Click on any of the purple Old Man's Beard symbols. The map shows multiple species, so make sure it's Old Man's Beard you've clicked on.

If there's a few weeds reported nearby, you'll see a list of all the weeds, so work through them one by one.

You'll see some basic information about the weed and possibly some location details.

The GPS position isn't always right, so you may need to hunt around a bit to find the Old Man's Beard.

If you need more info to help find it, click on the link under iNaturalist URL. 

This will open the iNaturalist page which will show more details including photos to help you find it.

Let's try finding a known Old Man's Beard patch.

Once Field Maps has been installed, opening Field Maps will default to showing our CAMS map.

After zooming in to my current location, I see I need to walk down the road a bit to get to the Old Man's Beard patch.

(voice: keith)

I'm getting close, so I'll click on the icon to find out more details about this patch.

There's no location details, so I'll click on the iNaturalist URL to see a photo of it.

That looks like the bank across the road from me.

Let's click on the photo, so I can zoom in and see where the Old Man's Beard is in the photo.

There it is on the top right of the bank.

(voice: keith)

Looking around the bank now, the Old Man's Beard vines seem to have been mostly controlled. But I can see some regrowth at the top of the bank.

---
![](OMB Mortimer 2.jpeg)

(voice: keith)

Walking around above the bank the new growth is a bit more clear.

I'll need to update the map to show that it is still alive.

If you control the weed, please fill out at least the "Treated?", "Date controlled", "How treated" and "Treatment substance" fields. 

You don't need to update the "Status update" field in this case, the status will automatically change based on the treatment fields you have filled in.

Congratulations!

You have now updated the status of this weed patch.

The map will be updated to show the new status within an hour after you've made the change.

You can check the updated map on either the mobile app or via the browser.

If it's not updated, check that you filled in the fields shown in this video. 

Also check you have clicked the Add button next to each modified field.

Checking this map, we see this dot has turned to "Red" to show there is active growth.

Updating the status might seem like a lot of work to start with, but it quickly becomes second nature.

In time, we hope to develop an app to make this easier on your mobile.
