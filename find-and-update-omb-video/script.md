# Updating Old Man's Beard status
```

(pause: 4)

![](CAMS Weed App.png)

Hi! On our mission to make Wellington Old Man's Beard Free, we're using a map to manage our efforts to control Old Man's Beard.

This map is colour coded to show which patches need control, which patches have been controlled, and which patches need checking.

The map was developed by EcoNet as part of its CAMS (Conservation Activity Management System) suite.

---
![](CAMS Weed App.png)

The weed status is reset to "Purple - Please Check" each Spring, so that the weed patches are checked for re-growth or seedlings.

![](CAMS Weed App.png)

With over 3,000 reported Old Man's Beard patches, we can't check them all!

We'd love your help to check some of them and update this map. 

This video shows you how to find these patches and update their status.

## Installing the weed map on your mobile
```

This section shows you how to install the map on your mobile device. 

The "CAMS public device map" link is in the description below. Open this link on your mobile.

Firstly it will install an application called ArcGIS Field Maps if you don't have it already.

Then open the link again and it will show the map. 

Select the option to allow Field Maps to access the device's location while using the app.

In future, you can just open Field Maps and it will show the map that you last opened.

```

![](CAMS Field Maps Initial.png)

You'll notice a lot of different coloured markers on the map. 

Each marker represents a weed patch and is coloured to show the current known status of the patch. 

---

![](CAMS Legend.png)

The common colours are:

Red: growth is occurring which needs controlling.

Purple: the patch needs checking.

Yellow: the patch has been controlled this year

And Green: there is no regrowth this year.
  
The shape of the marker also indicates whether control work is needed or not. Diamond shaped markers indicate that no weed control is currently needed.

---
![00:00-00:06](CAMS Field Maps OMB.mp4)

Click on the relevant weed marker.

If there's a few weed markers close together, they may show up as a list. 

You can work through the list until the relevant marker is highlighted. Alternatively, you can zoom in and click on the marker.

Once the weed marker is selected, some basic information about the weed patch will be displayed.

The GPS position isn't always right, so you may need to hunt around to find the weed.

If you need more info to help find it, click on the link under iNaturalist URL. 

This will open the iNaturalist page which shows more details, including photos, to help you find it.

Let's try finding a known Old Man's Beard patch.

Opening ArcGIS Field Maps, it shows the CAMS map.

After zooming in to my current location, I see I need to walk down the road to get to the Old Man's Beard patch.

I'm getting close, so I'll click on the icon to find out more details about this patch.

There's no location details, so I'll click on the iNaturalist URL to see a photo of it.

That looks like the bank across the road from me.

Let's click on the photo, so I can zoom in and see where the Old Man's Beard is.

There it is on the top right of the bank.

(voice: keith)

Looking around the bank now, the Old Man's Beard vines seem to have been mostly controlled. 

But I can see some regrowth at the top of the bank.

---
![](OMB Mortimer 2.jpeg)

(voice: keith)

Walking around above the bank the new growth is a bit more clear.

I'll need to update the map to show that it is still alive.

If you have controlled the weed, please update at least the "Treated?", "Date controlled", "How treated" and "Treatment substance" fields. 

You don't need to update the "Status update" field in this case, the status will automatically change based on the treatment fields you have filled in.

Congratulations!

You have now updated the status of this weed patch.

---

![](CAMS Weed App OMB Mortimer updated.png)

The map will be updated to show the new status within an hour after you've made the change.

You can check the updated map on either the mobile app or via the browser.

If it's not updated, check that you filled in the fields shown in this video. 

Also check you have clicked the Add button next to each modified field.

Checking this map, we see this dot has turned to "Red" to show there is active growth.

Updating the status might seem like a lot of work to start with, but it quickly becomes second nature.

In time, we hope to develop a mobile app to make this easier.
