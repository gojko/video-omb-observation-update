Hi! On our mission to make Wellington Old Man's Beard Free, we've created a map to manage our efforts to control Old Man's Beard.

This map is colour coded to show which patches need control, which patches have been controlled, and which patches need checking. 

---
![](./images/CAMS/CAMS Weed App.png)

The weed status is reset to "Purple - Please Check" each Spring, so that we check for any re-growth or seedlings.

With over 3,000 reported Old Man's Beard patches, we can't check them all!

We'd love your help to check some of them and update this map. 

This video shows you how to find these patches and update their status.

## Open the **CAMS public device map** 
```

The first thing you need to do is install our map on your mobile device by clicking on the link in the description below. 

Opening the link will prompt you to install an application called ArcGIS Field Maps if you don't have it already.

Then open the link again and it will show the map. Select the option to "Enable Location" while using the app.

In future, you can just open Field Maps and it will show the map that you last opened.

---

![](./images/CAMS/Field Maps Initial.png)

You'll notice a lot of different coloured markers on the map. 

Each marker represents a weed patch and is coloured to show the current known status of the patch.

```md

* Purple - the patch needs checking
* Red - growth is occurring which needs controlling
* Yellow - the patch has been controlled this year
* Green - there is no regrowth this year
```

(font-size: 50)

The common colours are:

Purple - the patch needs checking

Red - growth is occurring which needs controlling

Yellow - the patch has been controlled this year, and

Green - there is no regrowth this year

Click on any of the purple Old Man's Beard symbols.

This may show some basic information about the weed patch including its location.

The GPS position isn't always right, so you may need to hunt around to find the Old Man's Beard.

If you need more info to help find it, click on the link under iNaturalist URL. 

This will open the iNaturalist page which shows more details, including photos, to help you find it.

Let's try finding a known Old Man's Beard patch.

Opening ArcGIS Field Maps, it shows the CAMS map.

After zooming in to my current location, I see I need to walk down the road to get to the Old Man's Beard patch.

I'm getting close, so I'll click on the icon to find out more details about this patch.

There's no location details, so I'll click on the iNaturalist URL to see a photo of it.

That looks like the bank across the road from me.

Let's click on the photo, so I can zoom in and see where the Old Man's Beard is.

There it is on the top right of the bank.

---
![](./images/CAMS/OMB Mortimer 1.jpeg)

(voice: keith)

Looking around the bank now, the Old Man's Beard vines seem to have been mostly controlled. 

But I can see some regrowth at the top of the bank.

---
![](./images/CAMS/OMB Mortimer 2.jpeg)

(voice: keith)

Walking around above the bank the new growth is a bit more clear.

I'll need to update the map to show that it is still alive.

If you control the weed, please fill out at least the "Treated?", "Date controlled", "How treated" and "Treatment substance" fields.

Congratulations!

You have now updated the status of this weed patch.

---

![](./images/CAMS/OMB Mortimer updated.png)

The map will be updated to show the new status within an hour after you've made the change.

You can check the updated map on either the mobile app or via the browser.

If it's not updated, check that you filled in the fields shown in this video. 

Also check you have clicked the Add button next to each modified field.

Checking this map, we see this dot has turned to "Red" to show there is active growth.

Updating the status might seem like a lot of work to start with, but it quickly becomes second nature.

In time, we hope to develop a mobile app to make this easier.
